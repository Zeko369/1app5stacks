# Roundest (Ruby On Rails Version)

This was not fun.

## Setup

1. Install Ruby gems:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

Note: Running `bin/dev` is required for Tailwind CSS to work properly.

## Deployment

1. Install the Fly.io CLI
2. Launch with `fly launch` (yes it's actually that easy)
